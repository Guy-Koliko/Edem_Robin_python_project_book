# **Edem Robin Python Project Book** <br>
<p> This Book consist of personal projects I did on my own.</p>
<p>I decided to do something small at a time, I wanted to at least work on a project a week.<br>
 Every project in this book is my own idea turn into computer code. I always have project ideas<br>
 flowing through my head each time i walk on the street of Ghana ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­.. At first i thought i was geeting<br>
 mad, I have tried on my own to discord those thoughts but they keep coming back to me.
</p>
<p> I may not be the perfect computer programmer or a perfect developer but I believe this ten little words<br>
> If It Is To Be, IT Is Up To Me <br>
are absolutely valid, the solution is to start it now.
